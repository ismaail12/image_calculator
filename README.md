This project is a Flutter Calculator app designed to recognize and compute arithmetic expressions from images. The app allows users to either capture an image using the built-in camera or pick one from the camera roll. It processes the image to detect the expression and calculates the result, which is then stored locally for future reference.

### Key Features:
Image Input: Capture arithmetic expressions via camera or choose from the camera roll.
Expression Detection: Uses a third-party solution to detect and compute simple 2-argument operations (+, -, *, /).
Recent Results: Browse recent calculations stored locally.
Multi-Flavour Support: Build up to 4 app variants with different configurations:
Theme Variants: Red or Green.
Camera Variants: Camera Roll only or Built-in Camera.
Storage Engine: Store results in an encrypted file or a non-encrypted database.
Switchable Storage: Users can switch between storage engines in the app UI.
BLoC Architecture: The app is structured using the BLoC pattern, ensuring scalable and manageable code.
This project demonstrates expertise in creating configurable Flutter apps with compile-time and runtime variations, integrating third-party libraries, and managing system permissions effectively.
